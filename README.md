It's nice to meet you! My name's Andrew Robbins and I'm an independent Web Developer who enjoys helping agencies and companies build beautiful web experiences. I have a Bachelor's degree in Graphic Design and 5+ years of working with the web including many hours spent here and here. I currently live in Minneapolis, MN and work out of the CoCo in Uptown.

I consider myself an expert problem solver that blends complexity with simple and elegant solutions. I specialize in JavaScript CSS HTML and Wordpress. I love building responsive sites and working with JavaScript frameworks like Angular JS. Making the web beautiful is what I do bestâ€”let's build something amazing.

## Good luck ..
